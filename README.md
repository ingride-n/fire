# FIRE

## Overview
Welcome to the codebase of the Aivie Financial app! This is a toolkit that I created to support your personal finance journey. What does FIRE mean? FIRE stands for Financial Independence Retire Early. My hope is that I can contribute to expanding the resources available online for others to take control of their lives. Together we can achieve the independence we seek via economic empowerment in the numbers!

## Get Started
This app was built using `create-react-app` It is entirely client-side. Here is the list of frontend technologies and frameworks used:
- Material UI
- JavaScript
- React.js

To install dependences, run `npm install`. Follow these steps to build the project locally & test in development. 
- Run `npm start` 
- Open `https://localhost:3000` in a browser window. It automatically refreshes on each build.

## Privacy Policy
As stated above, this app is entirely client-side and always will be. What does that mean? Well, it promises data privacy by design. 

1. All data is ephemeral, disappears after the end of a user's session.
2. No data is collected or stored from any users, ever!
